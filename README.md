# Hey, I’m Julio 👋

I’m a Computer Engineer based in Granada, Spain 🇪🇸  
I like building digital products that feel useful, simple, and a little fun.

Right now I’m **open to work** (remote/hybrid) and also building personal projects on the side.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud architecture, AI-powered features, and better product thinking.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web/mobile products, startup ideas, and dev-focused tools.

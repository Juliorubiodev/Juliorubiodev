# Hey, I’m Julio Rubio 👋

I’m a Computer Engineer based in Granada, Spain 🇪🇸  
I like building digital products that feel useful, simple, and a little fun.

Right now I’m **open to work** (remote/hybrid) and also building personal projects on the side.

## A bit about me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Inku** and **Vicious** (a habit-gamification app). More details soon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud architecture, AI-powered features, and better product thinking.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web/mobile products, startup ideas, and dev-focused tools.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with product growth, distribution, and indie shipping strategies.
- 💬 Ask me about React, TypeScript, Flutter, Firebase, or building MVPs fast.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Japan, anime culture and mixing game mechanics with real-life productivity ideas.
